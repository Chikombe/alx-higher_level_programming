0x09. Python - Everything is Object

By working on this project, I achieved the following learning objectives:

Gained a deep understanding of the concept that "everything is an object" in Python.

Explored the characteristics of objects, including identity, type, and value.

Learned about mutable and immutable objects and their implications.

Understood object references, aliasing, and their impact on code behavior.

Familiarized myself with the lifespan of Python objects and how garbage collection works in Python.
