0x07. Python - Test-driven development

This project, titled "0x07. Python - Test-driven development," is a demonstration of the principles and practices of Test-driven Development (TDD) using Python. 

TDD is a software development methodology that focuses on writing tests before writing the actual code. 

It promotes code quality, reliability, and maintainability.

In this project, you will find a series of Python scripts and modules developed using the TDD approach.

These scripts cover various topics and exercises to help you understand how TDD can be applied in real-world scenarios.

Each script includes a set of corresponding tests to ensure that the code functions as expected.

Testing
Testing is a fundamental aspect of this project, as it follows the principles of Test-driven Development (TDD). To run the tests for a specific script, you can use the following command:
python -m doctest -v tests/SCRIPT_NAME.py
